# 🎮 Tic-Tac-Toe (Dockerized - Multi-stage + Distroless)

A simple Tic-Tac-Toe web game packaged with a **multi-stage Dockerfile** and a **distroless** final image for a minimal, secure container. This project demonstrates how to serve a static Tic-Tac-Toe web application using NGINX in Docker.

---

## ✅ What’s included
- The Tic-Tac-Toe app source already in the repo.
- `Dockerfile-multi-stage-distroless` - builds the app in a builder stage and produces a tiny distroless final image.
- Helpful instructions to build, run, and debug the container.

## 🐳 Dockerfile Overview
```dockerfile
# Stage 1: Build stage using Node.js Alpine image
FROM node:alpine AS build

# Set working directory for build stage
WORKDIR /workspace

# Copy server file to workspace
COPY server.js /workspace
# Copy static web app files to workspace
COPY tic-tac-toe-app/ /workspace/tic-tac-toe-app/

# Stage 2: Production stage using distroless image
FROM gcr.io/distroless/nodejs20-debian12

# Set working directory for production
WORKDIR /app

# Copy server file from build stage to production
COPY --from=build /workspace/server.js /app
# Copy static app files from build stage to production
COPY --from=build /workspace/tic-tac-toe-app/ /app/tic-tac-toe-app/

# Expose port 8080 for the Node.js server
EXPOSE 8080

# Run the server (distroless uses exec form)
CMD ["server.js"]
```

## Dockerfile (high-level explanation)

- **Base Image (builder)** → Uses a full image (e.g., `node`) to build the app and install dependencies.
- **WORKDIR** → Sets the working directory inside the builder stage.
- **COPY** → Copies source code and files into the builder.
- **Multi-stage COPY** → Copies only the production artifacts (build output) into the final image.
- **Final Image (distroless)** → Uses a distroless image (e.g., `gcr.io/distroless/nodejs20-debian12`) - tiny and secure with no shell.
- **EXPOSE** → Document the port the app listens on (note: distroless images do not require `EXPOSE` to run, but it's useful for documentation).
- **CMD** → Launches the app using the production binary/static files.
